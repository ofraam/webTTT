				</p>
				<p>
					WHAT YOU WILL DO: You will be asked to solve a Tic-tac-toe game problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					TIME REQUIRED: Participation will take approximately 10-15 minutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					RISKS: There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor for 20 minutes and using a mouse.
