			<h3>Wait, there's more!</h3>
			<p>
				In this study, we are looking at the way in which people solve complex problems such as the one you were
				presented with.
			</p>
			<p>
				When solving the problem, you considered <span class="numMovesPar">20</span> moves
				(this means that you clicked on squares in the tic-tac-toe board <span class="numMovesPar">20</span> times).
				The average number of moves participants in our study considered is <span id="numMovesAvg">15</span>.
			</p>

			<div id="high_entropy">
				<p>
					Compared to others, your problem-solving strategy was <i>more spread</i>.
					This means that you alternated between game paths that cover different parts of the game board.

				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="low_entropy">
				<p>
					Compared to others, your problem-solving strategy was <i>more focused</i>. This means that you tried
					alternative game paths that were close to each other.

				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="avg_entropy">
				<p>
					Your problem-solving strategy was <i>balanced</i>. This means that you explored some parts of the
					game board in depth, testing different responses of the players, while also exploring alternative
					game paths that covered different parts of the game board.

			<p>
				Here's a comparison between how you solved the problem and how others did: <br>
				The image on the left shows the number of times different players placed an X on each square.
				On the right image, we show the number of times you placed an X on each square.
				Darker Red means many clicks, Darker Blue means a small number of clicks.
				<br>
				By looking at these two images, you can compare your way of playing vs. all the other participants in the study.
